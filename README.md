# Cover-Letter-Generator

This is just a beginning template that I plan to add to. 

At the moment, its a quick shitty algo that just generically allows you to plug some info into some arguments that will generate your cover letter. This works well for cover letters that you just type/copy-paste into a field; examples being 'Wellfound.com' and 'Ycombinator'. 

Goal going forward will be to add a pdf output functionality.
